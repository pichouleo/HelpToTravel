                <h2> The art of travelling</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of reason to travel,
                     to rest, to visit or even to live there
                      (abroad or not). Whatever the reason, 
                      traveling is always a good thing, it creates 
                      change and everyone needs a change. So I'm going 
                      to show you some landscapes of cities, countries,
                        to encourage you.</p>

                        If people travel to big cities, it is mainly because it is 'to see', it is like this was an obligation for them. Cities like New York, London or even Paris are the most visited and appreciated cities. People go there mainly for sightseeing, walking and shopping.

                    <li id="japan"><p>Kyoto - Japan</p></li>
                    <div>
                        However, countries like Japan, China and Korea are almost as visited. These countries are considered emblematic, with their cities, their temples, their religions. To cite an example, the city of Akihabara located at the edge of Tokyo Bay, is a city where all the advertisements on the buildings are images or videos of animated or manga.

                        Finally, heavenly corners are also very popular, despite the fact that there are more tourists than locals. The islands are the most chosen places because they are the quietest and the least frequented. The term to represent these trips to these places is "rest", foreigners go there mainly to sunbathe, rest, bathe.
